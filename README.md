# Ecommerce_Price_Tracker
I built the project using Python and Flask. I used Requests and BeautifulSoup for web scraping, SQLite for storing product and price data, and SMTP with Gmail App Passwords for sending email alerts. The application follows a modular structure with separate files for scraping, database handling, and notifications.
